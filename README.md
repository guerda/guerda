Hi üëã 

I'm Philip, a nerd at ‚ù§ and developing in my free time. I programmed since I was 10 and I really like open data and open source software: [OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.org), [Mozilla Common Voice](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org) to name a few.  
I usually create smaller fixes, bug reports and other stuff here, so there are few source repos there.

Check out my (mostly German) blog: [guerdas Sammlung](https://guerda.de). I'm also on mastodon: <a rel="me" href="https://ruhr.social/@guerda">guerda on ruhr.social</a>

You can speak to me in German and English.
